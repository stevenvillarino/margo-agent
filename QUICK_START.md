## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### Step 1: Configure Your Environment

**Edit this file:** `/Users/stevenvillarino/Projects/Roku/margo-agent/.env`

```bash
# Required for AI agents
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_key_here

# Optional but recommended
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_key_here
JIRA_URL=https://roku.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your.email@roku.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_token_here
```

### Step 2: Test the System

```bash
# Activate the environment
cd /Users/stevenvillarino/Projects/Roku/margo-agent
source venv/bin/activate

# Test core components (no API keys needed)
python demo_simple.py

# See how messages work
python demo_message_explanation.py

# Full integration test (requires API keys)
python test_advanced_integration.py
```

## 💬 UNDERSTANDING THE MESSAGES

When you see: `✅ Message sent (ID: msg_68343dc9)`

**That means:**
- The message is stored in the Communication Hub's memory
- It can trigger real-world actions like:
  - Slack notifications to your team
  - JIRA ticket creation
  - Email alerts
  - Dashboard updates
  - Workflow automation

**The message flow:**
```
Sarah (Designer) → Communication Hub → Margo (VP Design)
                                   ↓
                            JIRA Ticket Created
                                   ↓
                            Slack Alert Sent
```

## 🎯 HOW MARGO WORKS AS YOUR "TOLLGATE"

### Margo's Role
- **Final design approval authority**
- **Strategic design vision keeper**
- **Business alignment validator**
- **Brand consistency guardian**

### How Decisions Flow to Margo
1. Design work happens at agent level
2. Issues and complex decisions escalate up
3. Margo provides strategic guidance
4. Final approvals come from Margo
5. Implementation proceeds with confidence

### Example Margo Decision
```
🎨 Sarah: "Login form design complete"
🧪 Alex: "QA passed with minor accessibility note"
🔍 Research: "Industry best practices suggest..."
                    ↓
🎯 Margo: "Approved! This aligns with our accessibility-first vision. 
          Ship it, and let's apply these patterns to our design system."
```

## 🛤️ REAL WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

### Scenario: New Feature Design Review

```
Day 1: 🎨 Sarah submits new TV navigation design
       💬 Hub routes to QA and Research agents
       
Day 2: 🧪 Alex finds accessibility issues
       🔍 Research finds better navigation patterns
       💬 Hub compiles feedback for Sarah
       
Day 3: 🎨 Sarah updates design with fixes
       💬 Hub escalates to Margo for strategic review
       
Day 4: 🎯 Margo: "Great work! This improves our TV UX significantly.
              Approved for implementation."
       🎫 JIRA creates development tickets
       📊 Dashboard shows progress
```

**Result:** Strategic design decision made with full context and team input
