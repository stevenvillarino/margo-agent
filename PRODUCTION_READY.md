EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_key_here
JIRA_URL=https://your-company.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your.email@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_token
```

### 3. Quick Start
```bash
# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Test core components
python demo_simple.py

# Test individual integrations
python quick_test.py

# Integration test (with API keys)
python test_advanced_integration.py
```
