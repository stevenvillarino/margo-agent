# Developer Log

## FastAPI Migration Complete (Aug 2, 2025)

**Migration**: Successfully converted from Streamlit to FastAPI

**Why FastAPI?**
- ✅ Vercel-compatible (serverless functions)
- ✅ Built-in API documentation at `/docs`
- ✅ Fast and modern Python framework
- ✅ Easy testing with TestClient
- ✅ Type hints and validation with Pydantic

**What Works**:
- Same chat functionality as Streamlit version
- File upload handling (PNG, JPG, PDF)
- Smart responses for design topics
- Comprehensive test suite (10 tests, all passing)
- Auto-generated API docs

**How to Test**:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run development server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080

# View API docs
http://localhost:8080/docs
```

**Deployment**:
- Vercel: Works with current `vercel.json`
- Production: Same interface as local development
- No more HTML/local discrepancy

## Previous: Local vs Production Delta Fix (Aug 1, 2025)

**Problem**: User reported discrepancy between local and deployment environments
- Local: Streamlit app (`app.py`) with interactive chat interface
- Production: Different HTML content showing basic page instead of chat

**Root Cause**: Streamlit can't run on serverless platforms like Vercel

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created `api/index.py` - serverless-compatible version with identical functionality
2. Updated `vercel.json` to point to `api/index.py` instead of `streamlit_server.py`
3. Replicated all chat logic in HTML/JavaScript:
   - Same smart responses for design topics (colors, typography, layout, accessibility)
   - Same file upload handling
   - Same user interface design
   - Same conversational flow

**Result**: Both environments now have identical chat functionality, just different tech stacks under the hood.
