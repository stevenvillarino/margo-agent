_**Assistant**_

I'll check if Exa is installed on this system by searching for it in the requirements and running a check command. Let me check the `requirements.txt` file to see if Exa is listed as a dependency: Now let me check if Exa is installed on the system by running a command to test it: Let me also check if it might be installed via pip as a Python package: Let me activate the virtual environment first and then check: 

---

_**User**_

to be clear I want to leverage exa from https://docs.exa.ai/reference/getting-started

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now - you're referring to the Exa AI search API from https://docs.exa.ai/. Let me check if the Exa Python SDK is installed in this project. I can see that the Exa Python SDK is not currently listed in the `requirements.txt`. Let me check if it's installed in the virtual environment: Let me check if there's a virtual environment or if we need to create one, and then check for Exa: Let me try with python3: The Exa AI search API is **not currently installed** in this project. To add Exa to your design review agent, you'll need to:

1. Install the Exa Python SDK
2. Add it to your `requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Exa API key

Would you like me to:
1. Add the `exa_py` package to your requirements.txt?
2. Install it in your environment?
3. Help integrate it into your design review agent?

The Exa API would be useful for your design review agent to search for design best practices, UI/UX guidelines, and reference materials from across the web to enhance the review capabilities.

---

_**User**_

yeah go ahead and install it so we can get started using exa

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll install the Exa Python SDK and add it to your `requirements.txt` file.

First, let me add `exa_py` to your requirements.txt: 
```

```
Now let me install the Exa Python SDK: I see that we need to use a virtual environment. Let me create one and install the dependencies: Now let me activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies: Perfect! Exa has been successfully installed. Let me verify it's working by testing the installation: Great! Exa is successfully installed and importable. The version attribute isn't available, but that's fine. Now let me create a simple example to show you how to use Exa in your design review agent.

Let me check if you already have environment variables set up for API keys: Now let me create a simple Exa integration example for your design review agent. I'll create a utility function that you can use: Now let me update your `.env.example` file to include the Exa API key: 
```

```
Now let me create a simple integration example showing how to use Exa in your existing design review workflow: Perfect! **Exa is now successfully installed and integrated** into your design review agent. Here's what I've set up for you:

let's add a quality evaluation agent that cross references feature guides, looks as all decisions 'checks in' with product, validate feature guide, looks as the design (i have openai key) and ensure research if any that it meets issues and that it addresses pain points and principles, then it i want to figure out how to deploy this so that i can build this in a slack bot to test out this poc. did you also review eery agent to optimize for its capabilities and all the output and prompt?

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent ideas! Let me create a Quality Evaluation Agent that cross-references feature guides and validates against product requirements, then help you with Slack bot deployment. First, let me create the Quality Evaluation Agent: Now let me update the enhanced system to include the Quality Evaluation Agent: 
```

```
Let me fix the imports and class names in the enhanced system: 
```

```
Let me fix the agent class names: Let me read the enhanced system file to see the current structure: 
```

```
Now let me add the Quality Evaluation Agent to the enhanced system: 
```

```
Now let me update the agents dictionary to include the quality agent: 
```

```
Now let me check the orchestrator to see how phases are structured and add the quality evaluation phase: Let me look at how phases are defined in the orchestrator to properly add the quality evaluation phase: Now let me create a Slack bot integration file for deployment: Now let me add the Slack dependencies to requirements.txt: Let me read the requirements file first: 
```

```
Now let me add the Slack bot configuration to the `.env.example` file: 
```

```
Now let me create a deployment guide for the Slack bot: Now let me optimize each agent by reviewing their capabilities and prompts. Let me start by checking the current prompts: Now let me create an optimized agent system with enhanced prompts and capabilities: Now let me create a comprehensive test script to validate all agents and their optimizations: Now let me run the validation script to test our complete system: Let me check the orchestrator class name: Let me fix the import in the enhanced system: 
```

```
Now let me also update the class usage in the enhanced system: Let me check how the orchestrator is used in the enhanced system: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

_**User**_

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

_**Assistant**_

Good, it looks like it's already using the correct class name. Let me run the validation again:

_**User**_

it would be great if say the end user interacted with these agents and it didn't have knowledge or lacks it or whatever, that it would recommend next steps, log the inquiry for the intended agent to intervine, also i want a workflow that if there are issues with said design that it would create a jira ticket issue for whatever the inquiry of the design or accessibility. and i want a way that theres a way that an eng or workflow that a qa link gets received and cross references it across the design spec and if there are discrepenies it would use playwright to validate it and then notify the corresponding people. the other thing is that say a product designer asks questions about if their design is 'on track' based on feature guide and if research was conducted in the past then it would let the designer know and how about if no research it would create a research study and all of this is before talking to margo agent; which the margo agent is a bit more 'serious' almost like a toll gate for common checks and balances where to main meeting would focus higher level thinking f2f. another thing for the design review is it would be great that it can aid the ind discovery process for designers for example, it would look at you know top common websites that help and provide guidelines in product design like Nielsen Norman so basically it would search the web and I think it could use the EXA agent, but you let me know and then the other thing is, it would also be great if this agent and or all these agents had the ability to you know again talk to every single one. I really wanna emphasize that.

_**Assistant**_

Excellent vision! You're describing a comprehensive design workflow automation system with intelligent agent coordination. Let me build this out step by step, starting with the core workflow orchestration and agent intercommunication system.
