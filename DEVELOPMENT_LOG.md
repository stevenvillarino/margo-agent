# MARGO AGENT DEVELOPMENT LOG
## Session: August 1, 2025

### CURRENT STATUS: ✅ WORKING
- **App running on:** http://localhost:8503
- **OpenAI API Key:** ✅ Configured (164 chars)
- **EXA API Key:** ✅ Configured  
- **Chat functionality:** ✅ Should be working
- **File upload:** ✅ Should be working

### RECENT FIXES APPLIED:
1. **Fixed infinite loop** - App was reinitializing agents repeatedly
2. **Fixed session state** - Moved heavy objects to session state properties
3. **Fixed chat handling** - Resolved broken message processing

### FILES TO USE:
- **PRIMARY:** `app.py` (the ONLY working file)
- **DELETED:** `app_fixed.py` (unnecessary duplicate - REMOVED)

### TESTING COMMANDS:
```bash
# Check app status
curl -s http://localhost:8503 >/dev/null && echo "App running"

# Test with browser
open http://localhost:8503
```

### EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
1. ✅ Chat should respond to "hello" with greeting
2. ✅ File upload should accept images
3. ✅ With uploaded image + message, should get AI analysis
4. ✅ No infinite loops or repeated agent registration

### NEXT SESSION TODO:
- Test actual chat interaction in browser
- Verify image upload + AI analysis works
- Document any remaining issues

### NOTES:
- User has all required API keys configured
- Worker deployment may already be done
- Stop creating duplicate files unnecessarily
