# ðŸŽ¨ Simple Design Review App

**ONE app. No complications. Actually clean now.**

## What it does

- Upload design files (PNG, JPG, PDF)
- Chat interface for design questions  
- Works without requiring file uploads
- Smart responses based on design topics

## How to run

```bash
# Local development
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

## Files that matter

- `app.py` - The main (and only) application
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies  
- `streamlit_server.py` - For deployment

## What I removed (for real this time)

- All backup files (app_*backup*.py)
- Demo files (demo_*.py)
- Test files (test_*.py) 
- Build scripts (*.sh)
- Extra config files
- Unused directories

## Current status

âœ… **Working locally**: <http://localhost:8502>
âœ… **Clean codebase** (no more file chaos)
âœ… **Smart chat** (helpful without file uploads)

That's it. One app. One purpose. Actually simplified.
