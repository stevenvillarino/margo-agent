# 🎭 Margo Agent - VP of Design Automation System

> **A sophisticated multi-agent system for design workflow automation where Margo (VP of Design) serves as the senior "tollgate" for strategic design decisions, supported by specialized agents handling different aspects of the design process.**

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Margo Agent system transforms traditional design workflows into an intelligent, multi-agent orchestrated process. It serves as a **pre-Margo gate** that handles common checks and balances, allowing face-to-face meetings to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Design Review** - Specialized AI agents for different aspects of design
- **🎯 Strategic Tollgate** - Margo VP agent for senior-level decisions
- **🔄 Workflow Automation** - Intelligent orchestration of design processes
- **📚 Knowledge Management** - Shared learning between agents
- **🔌 Enterprise Integration** - Slack, JIRA, Figma, and Confluence connectivity
