# Advanced Design Workflow Automation System

This is a comprehensive design review automation system that transforms the traditional design workflow into an intelligent, multi-agent orchestrated process. The system serves as a **pre-Margo gate** that handles common checks and balances, allowing face-to-face meetings to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.

## üéØ Overview

The Advanced Workflow System addresses your complete design workflow requirements:

### ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Design Review**
- **UI Specialist**: Design craft and visual consistency
- **UX Researcher**: User-centered analysis and research validation  
- **Creative Director**: Innovation and brand alignment
- **VP of Product**: Business strategy and ROI analysis
- **Accessibility Expert**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design
- **Quality Evaluator**: Feature guide validation and cross-referencing
- **Margo Agent**: Senior strategic review and final gate-keeping

### üîÑ **Intelligent Workflow Orchestration**

1. **Pre-Margo Screening**
   - Feature guide validation
   - Research history checking
   - Knowledge gap detection
   - Basic design review
   - Readiness assessment

2. **Margo Gate Decision**
   - Automated threshold evaluation

   print(system.communication_hub.agent_capabilities.keys())
   
   # Verify message queues
   messages = system.communication_hub.get_agent_messages("ui_specialist")
   ```

2. **JIRA Integration Issues**
   ```python
   # Test JIRA connection
   if system.jira:
       issue = system.jira.create_design_issue(
           title="Test Issue",
           description="Testing JIRA integration"
       )
       print(f"Test issue created: {issue}")
   ```

3. **Playwright Validation Issues**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall Playwright browsers
   playwright install --force
   
   # Check browser availability
   playwright install-deps
   ```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Processing**
   ```python
   # Enable parallel agent reviews
   config.parallel_reviews = True
   
   # Adjust agent load balancing
   config.max_concurrent_agents = 4
   ```

2. **Memory Management**
   ```python
   # Limit conversation history
   config.max_conversation_history = 100
   
   # Enable periodic cleanup
   config.cleanup_interval_hours = 24
   ```

## ü§ù Contributing

### Adding New Agents

1. **Create Agent Class**
   ```python
   class NewSpecialistAgent:
       def __init__(self, openai_key):
           self.name = "New Specialist"
           self.expertise = ["specialty_area"]
       
       async def review(self, design_data, context):
           # Agent logic here
           return ReviewResult(...)
   ```

2. **Register with System**
   ```python
   # Add to agent registration
   system.register_agent("new_specialist", NewSpecialistAgent(openai_key))
   ```

### Extending Integrations

1. **Add New Issue Tracker**
   ```python
   class CustomIssueTracker:
       def create_issue(self, title, description, priority):
           # Custom implementation
           pass
   ```

2. **Add New Research Provider**
   ```python
   class CustomResearchAgent:
       def search(self, query, context):
           # Custom research logic
           pass
   ```
