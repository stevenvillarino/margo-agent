# Archived App Files

This directory contains previous versions of the main Streamlit app that were kept as backups during development.

## Files:
- `app_old_backup.py` - Backup with full sidebar interface and VP preferences
- `app_original_sidebar.py` - Original sidebar-based interface 
- `app_old.py` - Another backup version
- `app_clean.py` - Clean chat interface without technical displays
- `app_intelligent.py` - Intelligent chat-based interface

## Current Active File:
The main application is now consolidated into `/app.py` in the root directory.

## Why These Were Archived:
- Multiple backup files created during iterative UI development
- Code duplication across 4,584+ lines
- Different UI approaches (sidebar vs chat vs clean)
- Proper version control should be used instead of backup files

## If You Need To Reference:
These files are kept for reference but should not be actively developed.
Use `git` for version control instead of creating backup files.
